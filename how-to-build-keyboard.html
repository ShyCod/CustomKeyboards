            <p>If you’ve ever asked yourself, “how do I build a custom mechanical keyboard?”, I have some info for you to get started based on my personal experiences in the hobby. This article will be where to start in this vast and, sometimes, confusing hobby. While it’s easy, it’s not as simple as just saying I want a custom board for ‘x’ amount of dollars. So let’s figure this out together.And to start figuring out things, let's first get a quick and basic understanding of the parts that go into a keyboard:</p>

                <p class="righttext"><strong>Keyboard Case</strong><br>The outer shell of the keyboard. This is self-explanatory and houses the internals of the board. Sometimes these are a single piece, and sometimes multiple. It’s an important decision as this will decide how your keyboard looks and some of the options that go in it.</p>

                <p class="righttext"><strong>PCB</strong><br>Next up we have the PCB (printed circuit board). Think of this as the brain of the keyboard. This is where you’ll put your switches and stabilizers on. These come in either solder or hot swap models. We’ll dive into that later.</p>

                <p class="righttext"><strong>Plate</strong><br>Then we have your plate. This is important! The plate assists in mounting your switches to the PCB. It allows the housing of the switch to essentially lock into place, which assists it in locking its position, and then the switch can be soldered, or seated for hot-swap, into the PCB.</p>

                <p class="righttext"><strong>Keycaps</strong><br>You can let creativity shine with these! These can be found on several websites and can be broken down into a few things. Profile, keycap sets, and artisan keycaps. If you’ve used gaming keyboards from big brands, you’re most likely used to OEM caps, in which case the Cherry profile is probably the easiest transition.</p>

            <p id="keyboard-layouts"><strong>Keyboard Layouts</strong></p>
            <p><br>Now that we have clarified what the basics are, we can make our biggest decision in the process of making a custom keyboard. This is picking our layout. This can be a tough decision for a lot of people simply because they are unsure about what size/layout they want. The most common sizes to most people are 60%, TKL, and Full. But there are tons of different sizes like 60%, 65%, 75%, TKL (tenkeyless), and 1800 layouts. So how do we decide?</p>
            <img style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="assets/images/parts/layouts.gif">
            <p>There are a few things to consider when picking a size. Deskspace is usually at the top of importance for most. If you have more space on your desk, then any of these work! But, if you don’t, something smaller like a 75% layout may be ideal.<br><br>The next thing you should consider is what you need it for, if it’s for work and you need specific keys, like an F row or arrows, this will play a huge factor in your decision making. If you play video games and don’t use anything but WASD, perhaps a 60% is ideal! This is a personal choice that you will have to take some time to figure out, but those are some suggestions that may help</p>

            <p>
                We know what layout we are aiming for now, and now we can choose a case. When you’re looking into a keyboard case there are a few things you want to take into consideration. First is your mounting style. There are a lot of interesting and fun mounting styles and I will try to summarize this into something very digestible</p>
