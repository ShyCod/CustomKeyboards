        <p class="title">Why You Should Consider a Custom Mechanical Keyboard</p>
        <p>Have you ever stopped to think about how often you use your keyboard? If you're like most people, you probably use it dozens of times a day for everything from typing up reports to chatting with friends. But have you ever stopped to think about what kind of keyboard you're using? Is it the best possible keyboard for your needs?</p>
        <p>There's a lot of talk these days about custom mechanical keyboards. Some people say they're better than normal keyboards, while others claim they're just a passing fad. So what's the truth?</p>
        <p class="strong">Durability</p>
        <p>Custom mechanical keyboards are increasingly becoming more popular than normal ones, and for good reason. These keyboards come with greater durability through the use of better quality materials such as  aluminum/brass/stainless steel/carbon fiber, and reliable mechanical switches. Furthermore, these superior components are usually easier to repair or replace if anything goes wrong due to their modular nature. This means that in most cases you're able to keep your keyboard alive and functional for a much longer time than a conventional one, potentially saving you money in the long run. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="strong">Improved Typing Experience</p>
        <p>Custom mechanical keyboards offer an unparalleled typing experience. Each keystroke is actuated through mechanical switches that provide feedback, with each press being both audible and physically distinct. By integrating these features into the design, custom mechanical keyboards provide an enhanced level of comfort and satisfaction to the typing process. Furthermore, the individual customization options available to users—from the switches used to the type of plate to the type of keycaps—allow them to set up a board that's completely personalized for their needs. For someone who types regularly, using a custom mechanical keyboard can make all the difference in terms of precision and overall usability. With their responsive mechanical mechanism and endless customization options, custom mechanical keyboards are able to provide a superior typing experience. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="strong">Beautiful Designs</p>
        <p>Adding a custom mechanical keyboard to your desk setup is a great way to give it a personal touch. With customizable designs, colors, and layouts, you'll be able to make your office space feel specifically tailored to you. It's the perfect way to spruce up the look of your setup, whether you're in need of a professional environment or just want something unique and fun. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="strong">Improved Productivity</p>
        <p>Custom mechanical keyboards can be an incredibly useful tool for those with a busy lifestyle, allowing time-starved professionals to boost their productivity and get more done in the same amount of time. Most custom keyboards come prepared with specific features such as programmable keys, macros, and rotary encoders, making it far easier and quicker to power through tasks such as typing out emails or memos, or photo/video editing. The numerous layouts available also means you'll be able to find the perfect keyboard or keyboard and macropad combination for your specific needs. Lastly, as silly as this may sound - your board might make you excited to work as they're extremely satisfying to type on!</p>
